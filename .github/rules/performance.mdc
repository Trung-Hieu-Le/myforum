4. Performance & Optimization

    Minimize I/O operations: Batch disk, network, or DB operations where possible.

    Avoid unnecessary recomputation: Use caching or memoization for expensive calculations.

    Optimize database usage: Select only required fields, use indexes, and avoid N+1 query problems.

    Paginate large datasets: Never load thousands of records at once in APIs or UIs.

    Reuse expensive objects: Avoid recreating heavy objects like DB connections or HTTP clients unnecessarily.

    Benchmark before optimizing: Always measure performance and compare solutions using profiling tools.

    Avoid excessive logging in production: Limit log verbosity in live environments to preserve performance.

    Defer non-critical work: Use background jobs or queues for tasks that donâ€™t need immediate user feedback.

    Use content delivery networks (CDNs): For static assets in web development.

    Compress assets: Minify JS/CSS, use gzip or Brotli for faster load times.
