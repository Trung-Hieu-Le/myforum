5. Testing

    Write unit tests: Every public method or business logic should be covered with unit tests.

    Write integration tests: Ensure modules interact correctly, especially at external boundaries (APIs, DBs).

    Use test fixtures/mocks: Avoid hardcoding test data or hitting real external services in unit tests.

    Follow test naming conventions: Test names should clearly describe what they are testing.

    Run tests automatically: Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines for every commit or pull request.
