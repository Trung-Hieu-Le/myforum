Unit tests for logic: Each public method should be unit-tested.

Integration tests for components: Use in-memory DB or Testcontainers.

Use BDD frameworks: Cucumber or similar for acceptance tests.

Mock external systems: Use mocks or containers â€“ no real dependencies.

Test edge cases: Include negative, boundary, concurrency, and error paths.

Run tests in CI: Any commit must auto-run all tests.

Test performance-critical functions: Benchmark algorithms and DB queries.

Use mutation testing: Ensure code is meaningfully tested.

Provide test data management: Use factories or fixtures.

Clean up after tests: Reset state, remove temp data.
