9. Documentation

    Write clear documentation: Cover setup instructions, code structure, architecture decisions, and usage examples.

    Document public APIs: Use OpenAPI/Swagger, PHPDoc, JSDoc, or similar for API and SDK documentation.

    Use README.md wisely: Provide a useful project overview, setup guide, and maintenance instructions.

    Maintain changelogs: Log all significant changes with semantic versioning (SemVer).

    Document dependencies and setup: Especially for local development, testing, and deployment.
