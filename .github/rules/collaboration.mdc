8. Collaboration & Code Reviews

    Use pull requests (PRs): Never commit directly to main branches.

    Review othersâ€™ code respectfully: Focus on clarity, correctness, security, and design.

    Request meaningful PR descriptions: Explain what, why, and how the changes were made.

    Break large PRs: Keep PRs focused and under a few hundred lines when possible.

    Enforce code ownership: Define code owners or reviewers per module or folder.

    Encourage pair programming: Especially for complex or risky changes.

    Use issue tracking: Link code changes to specific tickets or issues for context.

    Provide constructive feedback: Focus on helping the author improve the code, not judging them.

    Avoid merge conflicts: Regularly rebase/merge and communicate about large or concurrent changes.

    Celebrate good code: Acknowledge elegant solutions and well-structured PRs.
