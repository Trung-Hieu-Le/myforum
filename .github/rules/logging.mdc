6. Error Handling & Logging

    Use try-catch blocks appropriately: Catch known errors where recovery is possible — avoid global catches that suppress issues.

    Log errors meaningfully: Include stack traces, request context, and timestamps — but never sensitive info.

    Differentiate log levels: Use DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels to classify logs.

    Avoid swallowing exceptions: Never leave catch blocks empty — at least log the error.

    Return meaningful error messages: Help the user understand the issue without exposing internals.

    Gracefully degrade: Ensure the app continues functioning reasonably even when part of it fails.

    Monitor logs & alerts: Use tools like Sentry, Logstash, ELK, or Datadog to catch runtime issues.

    Standardize error formats: Use consistent structures in API error responses (e.g., JSON { code, message, details }).

    Retry on transient errors: Handle timeouts or rate-limited responses with exponential backoff where safe.

    Use assertions in critical logic: Help detect incorrect states early during development.
